Simple implementation of android's cover flow widget. It is largely based on excellent  code from Neil
http://www.inter-fuser.com/2010/02/android-coverflow-widget-v2.html

Example activity which is embedded into the library is shown below:

[![android-coverflow](http://img.youtube.com/vi/TXIejVMUaS8/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXIejVMUaS8)

Main changes were about performance improvements, layering adapters (including Image reflection layer), packaging as library project + custom attributes, so that cover flow can be configured in XML.

Example of usage is here:

[CoverFlowTestingActivity.java](https://github.com/Polidea/android-coverflow/blob/master/src/pl/polidea/coverflow/testingactivity/CoverFlowTestingActivity.java)

And here:
